# Bayes_Farquhar_Models

8 Photosynthesis Models based on 3 all combinations of 3 assumtions:

CaCc_Jm - Assumes infinite mesophyll conductance,
           electron transport based on empirical formula using a maximum rate (Jmax), quantum yield and a curvature parameters 
           there is no temperature dependency on parameters.
CaCc_Jf - Assumes infinite mesophyll conductance,
           electron transport based on chlorophyll fluoresces
           there is no temperature dependency on parameters.
CaCc_Jm_Temp - Assumes infinite mesophyll conductance,
           electron transport based on empirical formula using a maximum rate (Jmax), quantum yield and a curvature parameters 
           there is an Arrhenius style temperature dependency on parameters.
CaCc_Jf_Temp - Assumes infinite mesophyll conductance,
           electron transport based on empirical formula using a maximum rate (Jmax), quantum yield and a curvature parameters 
           there is an Arrhenius style temperature dependency on parameters.
CiCc_Jm - Assumes a mesophyll conductance limitaion,
           electron transport based on empirical formula using a maximum rate (Jmax), quantum yield and a curvature parameters 
           there is no temperature dependency on parameters.
